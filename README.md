View the original plugin located at https://www.forgebox.io/view/cbSwagger

Purpose: To allow the validation of swagger document files used with CFML progects utilizing cbSwagger, and to allow the swagger specification file to validate incoming data from api calls to the coldbox platform.

This project was created for a couple of reasons. 
First I had a need for for this feature with my current employer and I chose to make it a public project for the benefit of all. I will initially be applying only the feature set I need, then adding in additional features to make it OpenAPI compliant as time allows.
Second I have been coding for many years but it has all been behind the wall of private/corporate projects that I was unable to share. This one I can post publicly to demonstrate my skills and help out the community that has shown me so much support over the years.

To RUN:
Checkout the git code to your computer.
Install CommandBox by Ortus Solutions (Coldfusion/cfml CLI environment)
Run Commandbox and switch to the root directory of the git repository.
Type "Install" to install all the dependencies. This will also auto-start the local Lucee (or Coldfusion) server, assign a random port, and open a webpage with the port number.
