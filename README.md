# cbSwagger_validation
Validation engine for cbSwagger plugin for CFML

View the original plugin located at https://www.forgebox.io/view/cbSwagger

Purpose: To allow the validation of swagger document files used with CFML progects utilizing cbSwagger, and to allow the swagger specification file to validate incoming data from api calls to the coldbox platform.

This project was created due to a need for another client and I chose to make it a public project for the benefit of all. I will initially be applying only the feature set I need, then adding in additional features to make it OpenAPI compliant as time allows.

To RUN:
Checkout the git code to your computer.
Install CommandBox by Ortus Solutions (Coldfusion/cfml CLI environment)
Run Commandbox and switch to the root directory of the git repository.
Type "Install" to install all the dependencies. This will also auto-start the local Lucee (or Coldfusion) server, assign a random port, and open a webpage with the port number.
